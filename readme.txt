Use shortcodes to embed blocks from a bitbucket project page.

== Description ==

Use shortcodes to embed blocks from a bitbucket project page (project summary, last activity, etc).

= Use it =

Those two shortcodes are actually available to be used in your posts or pages :

* [wp-bitbucket user="USERNAME" project="ACOOLPROJECT" section="readme"] --> embed the project summary block
* [wp-bitbucket user="USERNAME" project="ACOOLPROJECT" section="newsfeed"] --> embed the project last activity block

Of course, you have to replace USERNAME and ACOOLPROJECT by the username and project you want to get the content from.
